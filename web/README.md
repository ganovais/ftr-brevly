## API Integration

The app is designed to work with a backend API. You can modify the `API_BASE_URL` in `src/services/api.ts` to point to your backend server.

Expected API endpoints:
- `POST /api/links` - Create a new link
- `GET /api/links` - Get all links
- `GET /api/links/:shortCode` - Get link by short code (for redirects)
- `DELETE /api/links/:id` - Delete a link
- `GET /api/links/export` - Export links as CSV

## Design Features

The application follows the design specifications with:
- **Clean Layout**: Two-column layout with form on left, links table on right
- **Empty States**: Friendly messages when no links exist
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during operations
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for validation and network issues
- **Mobile Responsive**: Stacks to single column on smaller screens
- **Professional Styling**: Consistent spacing, colors, and typography

## Local Development Notes

- Links are stored in `localStorage` for demo purposes
- The redirect functionality works for locally created links
- You can test the full flow by creating links and visiting them
- Port 5173 is used for the frontend (default Vite port)
